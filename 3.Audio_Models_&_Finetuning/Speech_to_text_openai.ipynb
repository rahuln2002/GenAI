I was thinking that you could be trusted Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?

Still got scars on my back from your knife Don't think it's in the past These kind of wounds they last and they last now Did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you And time can heal but this won't So if you're coming my way just don't Oh it's so sad to Think about the good times You and I Cause baby now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done Cause baby now we got bad blood Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And baby now we got bad blood Band-aids don't fix bullet holes You'll say sorry just for show If you live like that you live with ghosts Band-aids don't fix bullet holes You'll say sorry just for show If you live like that you live with ghosts If you love like that blood runs out Cause baby now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done Cause baby now we got bad blood Now we got problems And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And baby now we got bad blood Cause baby now we got bad blood You know it used to be mad love So take a look what you've done Cause baby now we got bad blood And I don't think we can solve them You made a really deep cut And baby now we got bad blood\n",
